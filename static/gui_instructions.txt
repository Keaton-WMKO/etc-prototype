Welcome to the W. M. Keck Observatory exposure time calculator! It will calculate SNR as a function of time, or vice versa. 

This tool updates output products in realtime as you modify input parameters. Mouse over and click on the plots to see SNR or required exposure time at a wavelength of interest. The plots are interactive, use the tool bar on the upper right of the plots to zoom, reset, save plots, etc. Use the sliding bar in the Exposure pannel to adjust exppsure time or SNR. The computed SNR is per unit resolution. Users can upload their own source SED in ECSV or FITS format for ETC calculations.
